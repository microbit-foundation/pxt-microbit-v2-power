# Makecode Extension to enable power management on micro:bit (V2)

Use this extension to add all the blocks you will need to use less power in your program when you are using the [latest micro:bit](https://microbit.org/new-microbit/).

This extension might be useful when you want to conserve battery power, such as during a data logging activity.


## Usage

### Put the micro:bit to sleep in a low power mode üí§

The ``||power.lowPowerRequest||`` block will ask the micro:bit to switch to low power mode at the next opportunity, such as when the current code operation has been allowed to complete, or inside ``||basic.pause(ms)||``.

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, function () {
    power.lowPowerRequest()
})
```

You can send ``||power.lowPowerRequest(LowPowerMode.Wait)||``. Then micro:bit will also pause until a full power event occurs.

The ``||power.lowPowerPause(ms)||`` block will ask the micro:bit to sleep for a set interval in milliseconds.

In low power mode, the micro:bit is asleep, and your program is paused. When the micro:bit wakes up to full power mode, your program continues from the point it stopped.

You can use the ``||power.lowPowerEnable(LowPowerEnable.Prevent)||`` and ``||power.lowPowerEnable(LowPowerEnable.Allow)||`` blocks to block low power requests until the code between the two blocks has finished running. It is expected that you would use these blocks in pairs.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    power.lowPowerEnable(LowPowerEnable.Prevent)
    led.plot(2, 2)
    basic.pause(1000)
    led.unplot(2, 2)
    led.plot(2, 1)
    basic.pause(1000)
    led.unplot(2, 1)
    power.lowPowerEnable(LowPowerEnable.Allow)
    power.lowPowerRequest()
})
```

### Wake up the micro:bit to full power mode ‚è∞

In order to wake up the micro:bit to full power mode, you need to define an event to trigger the wake up call.

You can wake the micro:bit when a button or pin is pressed. In this example, the micro:bit will wake up when Button A or Pin 0 has been pressed.

```blocks
power.fullPowerOn(FullPowerSource.A)
power.fullPowerOn(FullPowerSource.P0)
```

You can also wake the micro:bit at a set time interval in milliseconds. In this example, the micro:bit will wake up every minute and show a smiley face on the screen

```blocks
power.fullPowerEvery(60000, function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Happy)
    basic.clearScreen()
    power.lowPowerRequest()
})
```
