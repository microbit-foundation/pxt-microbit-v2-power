# Makecode Extension to enable power management on micro:bit (V2)

Use this extension to add all the blocks you will need to power the micro:bit on and off in your program when you are using the [latest micro:bit](https://microbit.org/new-microbit/).

This extension might be useful when you want to conserve battery power, such as during a data logging activity.

## Usage

### Put the micro:bit to sleep üí§

To make the micro:bit sleep, you need to send a request to power it down. The ``||power.powerDownRequest||`` block will ask the micro:bit to power down at the next opportunity, such as when the current code operation has been allowed to complete.

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, function () {
    power.powerDownRequest()
})
```

You can also ask the micro:bit to enter a ``||power.deepSleep||`` where it will pause until a wake up event occurs and power down at the next opportunity.

The ``||power.deepSleepPause(ms)||`` block will also ask the micro:bit to sleep for a set interval in milliseconds.

You can also use the ``||PowerDown.prevent||`` and ``||PowerDown.allow||`` blocks to block a power down request until the code inside the two blocks has finished running. It is expected that you would use these blocks in pairs.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    power.powerDownEnable(PowerDown.prevent)
    led.plot(2, 2)
    basic.pause(1000)
    led.unplot(2, 2)
    led.plot(2, 1)
    basic.pause(1000)
    led.unplot(2, 1)
    power.powerDownEnable(PowerDown.allow)
    power.powerDownRequest()
})
```

### Wake the micro:bit from sleep ‚è∞

In order to wake the micro:bit, you need to define an event to trigger the wake up call.

You can wake the micro:bit when a button or pin is pressed. In this example, the micro:bit will wake up when Button A or Pin 0 has been pressed.

```blocks
power.wakeOnEnable(PowerWakeup.A)
power.wakeOnEnable(PowerWakeup.P0)
```

You can also wake the micro:bit at a set time interval in milliseconds. In this example, the micro:bit will wake up every minute and show a smiley face on the screen

```blocks
power.wakeEvery(60000, function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Happy)
    basic.clearScreen()
})
```
